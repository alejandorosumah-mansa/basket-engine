- The vehicle runs with no one in the driver’s seat, or
- The vehicle operates in a mode where no occupant is expected to monitor or intervene.

3. Tesla or any Tesla-affiliated entity must make the unsupervised Full Self-Driving capability broadly accessible either through a robo-taxi or ride-hailing service open to the public, or inclusion as a standard or optional feature on newly sold Tesla vehicles, or a software update that enables unsupervised operation in current vehicles.

Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 if not extended by the federal government.

This market will resolve according to whether a bill extending the enhanced ACA premium tax credits beyond 2025 is signed into federal law by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. 

A qualifying bill may extend the enhanced ACA premium tax credits in any form, including shorter extensions, phased-down benefits, or narrowed eligibility, as long as the bill clearly continues enhanced premium tax credits that have wider eligibility and/or lower required income contributions relative to baseline ACA premium tax credits that would otherwise apply after 2025.

A bill replacing the ACA enhanced premium tax credits with an alternative form of healthcare subsidy, such as direct cash payments to a health savings account, will not qualify.

If the bill is signed into law before 2026, it will qualify to resolve this market, regardless of when it takes effect.

The primary source of resolution will be official information from the US federal government; however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.

2. Which party will win the House in 2026?
This market will resolve according to the party that controls the House of Representatives following the 2026 U.S. House elections scheduled for November 3, 2026.

House control is defined as having more than half of the voting members of the U.S. House of Representatives.

If the outcome of this election is ambiguous given the above rules, this market will remain open until the Speaker of the House is selected following the 2026 U.S. general election, at which point it will resolve to the party the Speaker is affiliated with at the time of their election to that position. If the elected Speaker does not caucus with any listed party this market will resolve “Other”.

This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.

Routine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic’s core structures also do not qualify.

The United States will be considered to have forcibly removed Khamenei from power if Khamenei is detained, captured, surrenders, or otherwise loses his position or is prevented from fulfilling his duties as Supreme Leader of Iran as a direct result of actions of force, including strikes, invasions, or other operations, carried out by United States government forces.

Actions of force means the use of physical force, including but not limited to kinetic military action (e.g., missiles, bombs, gunfire), ground operations or raids, special operations, invasions, or physical arrests or detentions carried out by United States government forces. Sanctions, diplomacy, or other non-physical actions will not qualify.

United States government forces refers to any active U.S. military (including U.S. Coast Guard), law enforcement, or intelligence personnel. Contractors confirmed to be acting under the orders of the United States government will count.

Actions of force carried out by United States government forces must directly lead to Khamenei’s removal from power. United States actions which merely contribute to or assist in Khamenei’s removal by other forces or through peaceful means will not suffice.

Qualifying examples (would count): The United States’ 2003 invasion of Iraq, which removed Saddam Hussein from power, and 1989 invasion of Panama, which led to Manuel Noriega’s surrender to U.S. forces, would count. The United States 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, which largely toppled the Taliban government and removed the Taliban leadership from power, would also have counted. The 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada, which removed the existing regime from power, would count.

Non-qualifying examples (would not count): The 2011 removal of Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya, however, in which the United States Military took part in a NATO operation against the Libyan military, including qualifying actions of force, but Gaddafi was removed by Libyan anti-government forces rather than U.S. government forces, would not count. The 1994 U.S.-led intervention in Haiti, in which the military regime relinquished power through negotiated departure rather than being forcibly removed from power by United States government forces as defined above, would not count. The removal of Slobodan Milošević from power in Serbia, which occurred through domestic political processes rather than Milošević's removal by United States government forces, would not count.

Institutional investors refers to large-scale business entities that purchase single-family homes in great quantities for investment purposes. Examples of such firms include Invitation Homes, Blackstone, and Apollo Global Management. A qualifying legislation or action does not need to be limited to such investors, as long as they fall directly under the action’s scope (e.g. an action applicable to owners of greater than 100 homes or investors with real-estate assets under management over $100 million would qualify, even if it is broader in scope than the definition presented here).

Single-family homes refers to residential properties designed for occupancy by a single household, including standalone houses and attached single-family residences (e.g., townhomes).

A qualifying legislation or action must explicitly apply to institutional investors or a defined class encompassing institutional investors, and must impose at least one of the following restrictions:
- a ban on the purchase of single-family homes
- a cap/limit on the number of single-family homes purchased
- another material financial or eligibility restriction on the purchase of single-family homes (e.g., a special tax or fee)

Any qualifying legislation or executive action (including executive orders, proclamations, and memoranda) which is completed within this market’s timeframe will count. Announcements, proposals, requests for study, or other actions that do not themselves impose a restriction or limitation on institutional investors will not count.

A “cap on credit card interest rates” is defined as a legally binding maximum interest rate (e.g., an APR ceiling, stated as a percentage) that makes it unlawful for credit card issuers to charge above a specified rate of interest on consumer credit cards. Non-binding guidance, agency recommendations, actions that only cap fees, or other actions that do not cap interest rates/APR will not qualify.

A qualifying action must apply broadly to consumer credit card interest rates in the United States. State-level caps or actions that only apply to a narrow subset of borrowers or lenders will not qualify. Limited exceptions, however, will not disqualify an action from counting (e.g. a cap which is broadly applicable to consumer credit card interest rates in the U.S., but exempts a limited and specific set of credit card products/categories would still count).

Any legislation or executive action (including executive orders, proclamations, and memoranda) which creates or directly orders the implementation of a qualifying cap will count. Announcements, proposals, requests for study, or other actions that do not themselves create or order the creation of such a cap will not count. A qualifying action within the market’s time frame will count regardless of when the cap goes into effect or any legal or other challenges it may face after enactment.

Hand-to-hand combat with the use of melee weapons between military personnel, will qualify. For example the 2020 Galwan Valley clash and the 2022 Yangtse clash would both count.

Non-violent actions, such as warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a ""Yes"" resolution.

If the final trading day of the month is shortened (for example, due to a market-holiday schedule), the official settlement price published for that shortened session will still be used for resolution. If no settlement price is published for that session, the market will use the most recent published settlement for the Active Month during June.

For CME Crude Oil (CL) futures contracts, the active month is the nearest of the contract months listed.

For example; if the spot month expires on a Friday the next listed contract will be considered the Active Month on the Wednesday prior to the spot month expiration.

Only the Active Month's official settlement price published by CME Group will be considered. Intraday trades, highs, lows, bids, offers, midpoint values, or indicative prices do not count.

Note that the settlement price may differ from the last traded price. CME's methodology to determine the settlement price can vary by commodity and contract.

Only days during June on which CME publishes an official settlement price for the Active Month will be included. Days without settlement prices (weekends, holidays, or market closures) are ignored.

Any continuous shading which reflects either ""Assessed Russian Infiltration Areas in Ukraine"", “Assessed Russian Control”, “Assessed Russian Advance In Ukraine”, or “Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours” will qualify. 

Once a qualifying condition is met, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.

If Russia comes into control of the specified territory as a result of a negotiated settlement, this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution, regardless of whether it is shaded red in the ISW map. However, an announcement of a negotiated settlement that gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established.

The primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable, information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used.

Initial seat counts will be based on the composition of the US Senate as of November 2, 2026, 11:59PM ET.

This market's resolution will be solely based on the number of seats held by the Republican Party in the US Senate for any state won by Trump in the 2024 Presidential election.
