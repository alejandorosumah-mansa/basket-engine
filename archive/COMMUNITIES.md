## Data Quality Impact

The new data quality filters removed 18,501 markets (91.7%) that were:
- Low volume (below 25th percentile)
- Flatlined (very low price variance)
- Limited price levels (< 10 unique prices)
- Inactive (< 30 days of actual price changes)

This eliminated fake correlations between unrelated markets and produced much cleaner communities.
